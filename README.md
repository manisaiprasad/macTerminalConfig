## zsh Config
I have used  Spaceship Zsh prompt which is a minimalistic, powerful and extremely customizable Zsh prompt. It combines everything you may need for convenient work, without unnecessary complications, like a real spaceship.

I installed it through npm
```
npm install -g spaceship-prompt
```
